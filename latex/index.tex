\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open\+GL setup was a really hard task. It took too much time to set up in Windows.~\newline

\item Bresenham\textquotesingle{}s Line and Circle algorithms were implemented easily in c++ as they dont require much work.~\newline

\item The research paper took signficant amount of work to understand.~\newline

\item Algorithm implementation was not that easy but the pseudocode given helped in implementing it.~\newline

\item Passing wrong pointers was a mistake that took too long to recify.
\item I learnt how to debug in VS Code during this course of this assignment which was used in recitifying the above mistake.
\item Timing analysis also took a while to learn i.\+e. where to put start and end points.
\item Looking up for Open\+GL commands also took some time as I was unable to find good sources for them.
\item We also implented a small function which allows user to select desired colors for components. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_algoanalysis}{}\doxysubsection{Algorithm Analysis \+:}\label{index_algoanalysis}
The time required by Algorithm TR is completely determined by the while loop because S\+E\+T\+UP iS executed exactly once per node of the tree.~\newline

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Let F(\+T) be the number of times the test of the loop succeeds, i.\+e., the number of times the body of the loop is executed for a tree T.
\item F(\+T) = n(\+T) -\/ h(\+T). The proof can be shown by induction on N, the number of nodes in T.
\item The best case is a degenerate tree in which no node has two sons; then n(\+T) = h(\+T) and the loop body is never executed.
\item The-\/ worst case is a complete binary tree for which the loop is executed about n(\+T) -\/ lg n(\+T) times.
\item Algorithm TR can easily be extended to handle m-\/ary trees without affecting its linear performance.(This wasn\textquotesingle{}t implemented in this assignment.)~\newline
 ~\newline
Issues with algorithm \+: ~\newline

\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Algorithm TR run into a problem for many trees in which one subtree is wide and the other consists of just a few nodes.
\item A second issue in discretization is that coordinates must be given integer values. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_rem}{}\doxysubsection{Remarks \+:}\label{index_rem}
The research paper gave us insight on how a problem as simple as drawing a tree can involve such detailed algorithm.~\newline
 Implementation of all the three algorithms was a challenging but rather fun task.~\newline
